"Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?"

Artemis Financial, as the name suggests, is a financial consulting company that wants to develop individualized financial plans for their customers. Within that plan contains savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. The issue that they wanted me to address was the security mesures in order to help them protect their client's personal information from any cyber attacks.

"What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?"

It is important to code securely because people are entrusting corporations their highly sensitive information, so coding securely is a must. If we are not coding securely, then we are putting not only corporations in danger of trust and liability from the people but the people's information in danger as well. If the information is not secure, then of course it will naturally fall into the wrong hands. Software security adds value to a company's overall well being by entrusting their clients information and will allow corporations to do further business with more clients because they have a air tight software security making information breach impossible.

"Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?"

In my experience, the most challenging of the vulnerability assessment was finding the right JAVA version to run testings on the product. The thing is, I never really experienced working with vulnerability tests in that regard. It feels as though everytime when I run a test, the test would terminate generating multiple errors. At the same time, upon reading the errors it made me realize it was a JAVA version issue, not a code issue.

"How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?"

I increased the layers of security by establishing a powerful algorithm cipher "SHA-256" to help amplify the security making sure the user's data input avoids any potential collision from another user's input.

"How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?"

When I finished refactoring the code, I checked by using the Maven tool if there were new vulnerabilities that popped up.

"What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?"

Maven is a helpful tool that can be useful in future assignments. I like how using Maven can help identify any potential vulnerabilities that exist.

"Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?"

I may show my future employers how I generated a dependency check report from using Maven to demonstrate how to identify any potential vulnerability that may exist within the code and what to do to fix it.
